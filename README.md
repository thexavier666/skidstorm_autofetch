# Skidstorm Rank Autofetch

## About Skidstorm

Skidstorm is a top-down racing game released on both Android and iOS, developed by Immobile Games, a Finnish game studio.
The copyrights to the game was later handed off to Cheetah Games.
However, due to unknown reasons, the game was eventually removed from Google Play Store and iOS app store.

## About this Repo

It fetches player information, such as rank/number of games played/medals, as well as country-wise player information from Cheetah servers, and displays the results in a dynamic manner.
It uses the Bottle API to create RESTful APIs, which is internally used by the application.

However, since the game was eventually closed down, the servers were also shut down, thus the repo is no longer being updated.
This repo serves as a nice example of how to properly develop and use REST APIs.
